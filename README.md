BASED ON THE ODIN PROJECT 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum]

This is the first project of web development 101 track, based on the Odin Project Curriculum.
The objective is to create a Google.com homepage Layout using CSS and HTML.

By finishing this project, the student has demonstrated basic CSS and HTML skills.


Anyway, I found out that to create the Google.com layout just like the real one, the CSS and HTML skills I have learnt via TOP were not enough and I need to use outside resources, like www.w3schools.com, and learnt some "Advanced" CSS to get the output I want. It's great though, learning by doing is surely the best learning method for me.

I also took some freedom and did not use too many <div>. I only used codes that I believed were necessary. I might be wrong and I believe I will find the correct and best way to code when I learn more :)
